    <para id="id1169368232908">If you do want to learn this material, you should get the textbook, <emphasis effect="italics">Thinking It Through</emphasis> by Kwame Anthony Appiah. All of the materials that are available are designed to help students who are reading the book, and the materials by themselves will not be useful as a replacement for the book. This course is constructed around reading the book, and is designed to (1) familiarize students with several of the main areas of philosophy and (2) help students improve their reading comprehension skills (and their thinking skillsâ€”the two skills go together). </para>
